 flavor_lit.14.t:0 "The succesion of Svitrigaila"
 flavor_lit.14.d:0 "Svitrigaila, the deposed Grand Duke, has died of old age. He has bequeated both of his duchies, Kiev and Galicia-Volhynia to lithuania. We could dispute this action, demanding that galicia-volhynia is given to Poland for a more direct control, or even force the integration of Kiev even if that angers the lithuanian nobility."
 flavor_lit.14.a:0 "Respect the wishes of Svitrigaila"

 flavor_lit.14.c:0 "Demand both Kiev and Galicia-Volhynia"
 flavor_lit.15.t:0 "The Vytautas reforms"
 flavor_lit.15.d:0 "While Lithuania has been ravaged by civil war and cultural unrest, it still has strong duchies and Bajorais leading them. Those same Bajorais are now offering us support and council, which would lead to better administration longterm by following the reforms of the late Vytautas. Meanwhile, the Sejm is offering us their full support, should we only veto those reforms."

 flavor_lit.16.t:0 "The Treaty of Melno"
 flavor_lit.16.d:0 "During the Polish-Lithuanian civil war, the Livonian Order supported Svitrigaila, and even offered him the crown of Lithuania and to become its subjects. Alas, the inconclusive civil war stopped these plans from becoming reality. Now the Livonian Order is seen as weak and has lost support of its own people. It's time we take revenge for the Baltic Crusades."
 flavor_lit.16.a:0 "They will be ruled by the Bajorais!"

 flavor_lit.17.t:0 "The Northern Marches"
 flavor_lit.17.d:0 "While the duchies of Polotsk and Smolensk initially supported Svitrigaila, they left the Polish-Lithuanian civil war early to prepare their duchies against a posible Muscovite offensive. They are gladly offering us their troops and services if we agree to keep to support the march status of these duchies. Otherwise, we could force them to integrate faster into either Lithuania or Poland even if this action would leave those duchies weaker against an enemy invasion"
 flavor_lit.17.a:0 "They shall remain vigilant against muscovite aggresion"
 flavor_lit.17.b:0 "Integrate them into Lithuania"

 flavor_lit.18.t:0 "Reign Chernigov"
 flavor_lit.18.d:0 "While the duchy of Chernigov didnt support any side during the Polish-Lithuanian civil war, now their Grand Dukes are declared they loyalty to the crown. The duchy of Chernigov has grown rich and plentiful, and while we would suffer some oposition, we could force that land into our Polish Hinderland instead of letting in re-integrate to Lithuania."

 flavor_lit.19.d:0 "The Zaphorozie cossacks have managed to carve a Grand Duchy out of the Crimean lands by fighting side to side with the Polish and Lithuanian soldiers. Now, their Ataman is kneeling to our Commonwealth and offers their full support, should we secure their autonomy and security against foreing invasions."
 flavor_lit.19.a:0 "We will guarantee their autonomy for the time being."
 flavor_lit.19.b:0 "Nonsense, those lands are righful land of the Bajorais"
 flavor_lit.19.c:0 "They must be integrated into our Polish realm"
 flavor_lit.20.t:0 "Cossack Wars"
 flavor_lit.20.d:0 "The frontier between Crimea and Zaphorozie has always been fluid, with land exchanging hands as one side became stronger, or weakened. Now, the Zaphorozian cossacks are preparing an incursion into the Crimean lands to reclaim old lands and are asking for our support, both in men and in money. If they are suscessful they could bring great gains to our crowns, but if they recieve no support they might fail."
 flavor_lit.20.a:0 "Both Poland and Lithuania will commit to this endeavour."
 flavor_lit.20.b:0 "Make Lithuania pay for it"

 flavor_lit.102.d:0 "The cossack messenger brings news of the conflict between Crimea and Zaphorozia, with Lithuanian help they have managed to push back the Crimeans and seize some territory, but not without loses, after a brief respite, he shows us the new maps."
 flavor_lit.103.d:0 "A tattered cossack messenger brings news of the conflict between Crimea and Zaphorozia, without any help, the Zaphorozian cossacks still had to fight the Crimean khanate and the conflict is progressing worse than expected, doubtful, he shows us the new maps"

 #polish lithuanian civil war events
 pol_lit_cw.1.a:0 "The Commonwealth will survive"
 pol_lit_cw.1.t:0 "Civil war between the Sejm and the Bajorais"
 pol_lit_cw.1.d:0 "The tensions between the Polish Sejm and the Lithuanian Bajorais have reached a breaking point. Both factions have called their banners and for the time being, refuse to try any negotiations. While this conflict is on-going we will have great problems to consolidate our subjects, we must force both factions to stand down and bow to [Root.GetName].
 
 pol_lit_cw.2.a:0 "The nobility has been reigned"
 pol_lit_cw.2.t:0 "Civil war ends"
 pol_lit_cw.2.d:0 "While the Polish and the Lithuanian nobilities fought, [Root.GetName] managed to raise enough loyal troops and support to defeat both factions, that have seen their influence curtailed for the time being. Even if this civil war is behind us now, the Commonwealth has suffered enough loses to be set back for the time being. Will we ever leave the cycles of hatred between Polish and Lithuanians behind? 

 #polish events
 flavor_pol.25.t:0 "The Sejm proposes the invasion of Silesia"
 flavor_pol.25.d:0 "While the Commonwealth its in a period of inestability that makes offensive wars dangerous, the Sejm has proposed [Root.GetName] to initiate an invasion of Silesia now that the kingdom of Bohemia has been weakened after the hussite wars. It's certain that having the Sejm support will easy this conquest, but they also demand a price for it."
 flavor_pol.25.a:0 "Accept the proposal of the Sejm"
 flavor_pol.25.b:0 "Ask only for minimal support"
 flavor_pol.26.t:0 "A matter of faiths"
 flavor_pol.26.d:0 "Catholic Sejm. Orthodox Bajorais. Two factions, two religions fighting for control. There hasnt been declared a oficial religion in the Commonwealth yet, and so, both factions are pushing for their own to be declared as the true and only religion. No matter the choice, someone is going to be angry."
 flavor_pol.26.a:0 "We are catholic first and always"
 flavor_pol.26.b:0 "I shall have no infighting for such trivial matters"
 flavor_pol.26.c:0 "Orthodox should be our true religion"
 flavor_pol.27.t:0 "Deal with the Sejm"
 flavor_pol.27.d:0 "With the renewal of the Polish-Lithuanian union, The Sejm wants to secure their preferential power on the union. While they offer great support to our [Root.getName] and accepting their demands would ensure that [Root.GetName] policies would pass without getting vetoed, doing so means we will lose strenght in favour of our estates"
 flavor_pol.27.a:0 "There is nothing we can do, sign the Pacta Conventa"
 flavor_pol.27.b:0 "Extend the Pacta Conventa to the Bajorais."
 flavor_pol.27.c:0 "Reject the proposal"
 flavor_pol.28.t:0 "A question of rights and privileges"
 flavor_pol.28.d:0 "With the slow integration of the lithuanian Bajorais into Poland, the Sejm has been slowly displaced in its power, although they are in no way threathened yet, they are demanding [Root.GetName] for assurances that they will retain their privileges and to limit the power of the Bajorais."
 flavor_pol.28.a:0 "The Sejm will have its guarantees"
 flavor_pol.28.b:0 "All the nobles should have equal rights..."
 flavor_pol.28.c:0 "All the nobles should have equal rights... None!"
 flavor_pol.29.t:0 "Royal Elections"
 flavor_pol.29.d:0 "With the death of our late ruler, a convocation sejm has been called to screen the candidates, one of which will be chosen to become the leader of the commonwealth"
 flavor_pol.29.a:0 "The Polish candidate shall be selected"

 flavor_pol.29.e:0 "Lets pick a foreign noble"
 flavor_pol.101.t:0 "The Bajorai purge"
 flavor_pol.101.d:0 "It's late at night, but yet [Root.GetName] is working without stopping at its residence. Without warming, four Bajorai nobles interrupt [Root.GetName]. \"My liege, our rights, lands and our own people have been opressed too long, we demand you must act up and protect us, your loyal subjects, or we will consider this a breach of the Commonwealth.\""
 flavor_pol.101.a:0 "\"It's treason then...\""
 flavor_pol.101.b:0 "Agree and grant them concessions"
 flavor_pol.102.t:0 "The Sejm Coup"
 flavor_pol.102.d:0 "It's late at night, but yet [Root.GetName] is working without stopping at its residence. Without warming, four Slaytza nobles, members of the sejm interrupt [Root.GetName]. \"My liege, our rights, lands and our own people have been opressed too long in favour of the lithuanian Bajorais, we demand you must act up and protect us, your loyal subjects, or we will consider this a breach of the Commonwealth.\""
 flavor_pol.102.a:0 "\"It's treason then...\""
 flavor_pol.102.b:0 "They are right, its Poland first and always"
 
 
 #veto events
 flavor_pol.103.t:0 "The Bajorais refuses to allow the mobilization of more troops"
 flavor_pol.103.d:0 "Since the issuing of the Henrykian Articles and the Pacta Conventa the King had very little power of his own. If he was to make policies, of war for example, he had to also have the consent of the Lithuanian Bajorais. Sometimes kings tried to drag the country into conflict and thus force the Bajorais to comply out of necessity or by building a domestic political coalition which were changing tit for tat. But often the Bajorais plainly said no."
 flavor_pol.104.t:0 "The Bajorais comply with your policies"
 flavor_pol.104.d:0 "The Veto itself was merely the most obvious symptom of a political disease that went far deeper. The first veto was not repeated for seventeen years, the second not for another ten. Then it became endemic in parliamentary life. The right to cast a veto grew into fetish, particularly among the minor Szlachta and Bajorais who saw it as a symbol of their personal involvement in the Commonwealth, as well as the ultimate guarantee of their freedoms. That the King viewed it differently is obvious. One should know that policy-making in Poland-Lithuania was not frozen because of the power of the veto. The King had to create Grand Compromises to ensure an at least acceptable outcome. However, as the Polish society slowly lost its consensus it was harder and harder to reach a compromise. It was especially cumbersome when planning and scheming had been going on for many months and suddenly in the last minute of passing the proposal in the Sejm, Someone rose and threw a Veto... Then again, sometimes the proposal actually passed."
 flavor_pol.105.t:0 "The Bajorais veto your policies"
