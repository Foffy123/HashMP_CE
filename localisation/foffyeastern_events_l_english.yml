 flavor_lit.14.d:0 "Svitrigaila, the deposed Grand Duke, has died of old age. He has bequeated both of his duchies, Kiev and Galicia-Volhynia to lithuania. We could dispute this action, demanding that galicia-volhynia is given to Poland for a more direct control, or even force the integration of Kiev even if that angers the lithuanian nobility."

 flavor_lit.15.d:0 "While Lithuania has been ravaged by civil war and cultural unrest, it still has strong duchies and Bajorais leading them. Those same Bajorais are now offering us support and council, which would lead to better administration longterm by following the reforms of the late Vytautas. Meanwhile, the Sejm is offering us their full support, should we only veto those reforms."

 flavor_lit.16.d:0 "During the Polish-Lithuanian civil war, the Livonian Order supported Svitrigaila, and even offered him the crown of Lithuania and to become its subjects. Alas, the inconclusive civil war stopped these plans from becoming reality... until now. Encroached by external powers and weakened by civil unrest and the defeats at the civil war, the Livonian Order comes again reoffering the same treaty."

 flavor_lit.17.d:0 "While the duchies of Polotsk and Smolensk initially supported Svitrigaila, they left the Polish-Lithuanian civil war early to prepare their duchies against a posible Muscovite offensive. They are gladly offering us their troops and services if we agree to keep to support the march status of these duchies. Otherwise, we could force them to integrate faster into either Lithuania or Poland even if this action would leave those duchies weaker against an enemy invasion"
 flavor_lit.17.a:0 "They shall remain vigilant against muscovite aggresion"
 flavor_lit.17.b:0 "Integrate them into Lithuania"
 flavor_lit.17.c:0 "They will respond to the Sejm now"
